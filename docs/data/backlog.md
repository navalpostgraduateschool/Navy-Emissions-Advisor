# Backlog 

A few important things that need to be done still include:

1. Add "CUI" markings to the page

2. Changing the days underway percentages prevents the pie chart from rendering (the table and charts will update, but the pie chart is hidden)

3. The layout of the nps.edu/web domain version has a redundant ribbon (heading toolbar).  One of them needs to be removed (likely the second one).

4. A note should be added when the fictitious data file is used (and the CUI marking dropped) so it is clear if the cui data file is moved or becomes inaccessible.
